# Interview Scheduler

This full-stack application was created mainly using React with JS, HTML, CSS incorporated as well.

This application is a pseudo interview scheduler that allows users to book and edit interviews with interviewers in a choice between Monday to Friday within one week. The scheduler is pre-populated by data forked from the Lighthouse Labs scheduler-api (also located within my repository list).
